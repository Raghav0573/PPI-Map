# PPI-Map
Creates a protein-protein interaction network based on the number of nearest neighbours or a distance threshold. 

In this python notebook you simply enter the PDB id of your protein and how you want to calculate the nearest neighbours in the generate_PPI function. The generate_PPI function calls the helper functions to fetch, calculate the nearest neighbours and draw the network.
